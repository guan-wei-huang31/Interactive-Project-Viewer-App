              <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Who am I?</h2>
              <p class="mt-2">
                I worked as a semiconductor engineer for more than five years in
                Taiwan, where the industry continues to grow rapidly. In my
                previous role, my primary responsibilities were designing chips
                and overseeing the device manufacturing processes, including
                developing and producing cutting-edge chips with the potential
                to influence the world.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-2">
                During my years of work, even though I was in the hardware
                field, I observed a significant transformation in software
                development, largely driven by advancements in machine learning
                (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, I noticed
                that many roles in the hardware industry are being replaced by
                AI and ML, further emphasizing the profound impact of these
                technologies on the industry.

              <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">To be a software engineer</h2>
              <p class="mt-2">
                My background is in semiconductors, and as a beginner in the
                software field, I have limited knowledge. However, I am deeply
                passionate about learning various programming languages.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-2">
                I began with Python, R, and MATLAB, where I developed automation
                programs to streamline routine tasks and worked on Data
                Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to optimize speed and memory
                usage.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-2">
                I also contributed to the development of a device simulation
                system integrating HSPICE, SPECTRE, and C++. Additionally, I
                created regression test cases using Perl and various scripting
                languages.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-2">
                I understand that in the software field, it is essential to
                continuously learn and adapt to new technologies. I am committed
                to pushing myself to achieve this goal.
